Fast EP
-------

Along the same lines as fast_dp - trying to phase your data by experimental
means, in the minimum possible time, using the minimum possible input (in
particular, starting from the output of fast_dp only.)

Will make substantial use of SHELXC/D/E, the MP version of SHELXD and also a
cluster. This will also make substantial use of CCTBX code, to handle a number
of the steps including things like symmetry operations.
